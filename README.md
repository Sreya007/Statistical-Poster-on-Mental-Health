# Statistical-Poster-on-Mental-Health
This project presents a statistical analysis exploring how mental health affects academic performance among university students. Data were collected from 120 students through an anonymous Google Forms survey, focusing on overwhelm, confidence, sleep, support, and academic impact. 

Summary

Over 65% of students report that mental health affects their academic performance. Emotional overwhelm, confidence levels, and perception of support systems play major roles. The study highlights the need for improved university support and greater mental health awareness. 

Key Analyses

Chi-square & Fisher’s Exact Tests:
Overwhelm is significantly linked to academic difficulties.

Spearman Correlation:
Higher overwhelm → lower academic confidence.

Logistic Regression:
Belief that support improves academics is the strongest predictor of mental health impact.
